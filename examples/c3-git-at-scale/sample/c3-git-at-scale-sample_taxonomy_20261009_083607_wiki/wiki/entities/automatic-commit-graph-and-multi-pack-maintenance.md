# Automatic commit-graph and multi-pack maintenance

Updating advanced Git structures in the background as history and pack data grow.

## Evidence

- **s04_p02** (accepts) · [[sources/s4|Scalar philosophy]]
  > Using \`scalar register\` on an existing Git repository will give you these benefits: \* Additional compression of your \`.git/index\` file. \* Hourly background \`git fetch\` operations, keeping you in-sync with your remotes. \* Advanced data structures, such as the \`commit-graph\` and \`multi-pack-index\` are updated automatically in the background. \* If using macOS or Windows, then Scalar configures Git's builtin File …
- **s05_p07** (accepts) · [[sources/s5|Introducing Scalar]] · Modified Size
  > The \*modified size\* is the number of paths in the working directory that differ from the version in the index. This includes all files that are untracked or ignored by Git. This size determines the minimum amount of work that Git must do to update the index and its caches during the core commands. Without assistance, Git needs to scan …
- **s05_p09** (accepts) · [[sources/s5|Introducing Scalar]] · Lesson 3: Don’t wait for expensive operations
  > \*There is no free lunch\*. Large repositories require upkeep. We can’t make users wait, so we defer these operations to background processes. Git typically handles maintenance by running garbage collection (GC) with the \`git gc --auto\` command at the end of several common commands, like \`git commit\` and \`git fetch\`. Auto-GC checks your \`.git\` directory to see if certain thresholds …
- **s05_p10** (accepts) · [[sources/s5|Introducing Scalar]] · Set recommended Git config settings
  > The config step updates your Git config settings to some recommended values. The config step runs in the background so that new versions of Scalar can update the registered repositories after install. As new config options are supported, we will update the list of settings accordingly. Some of the noteworthy config settings are: 1. We disable auto-GC by setting \`gc.auto=0\` …
- **s05_p11** (accepts) · [[sources/s5|Introducing Scalar]] · Fetch in the background
  > The fetch step runs \`git fetch\` about once an hour. This allows your local repository to keep its object database close to that of your remotes. This means that the time-consuming part of \`git fetch\` that downloads the new objects happens when you are not waiting for your command to complete. We intentionally do not change your local branches, including …
- **s05_p12** (accepts) · [[sources/s5|Introducing Scalar]] · Clean up loose objects
  > As you work, Git creates “loose” objects by writing the data of a single object to a file named according to its SHA-1 hash. This is very quick to create, but accumulating too many objects like this can have significant performance drawbacks. It also uses more disk space than necessary, since Git’s pack-files can compress data more efficiently using delta …
- **s05_p13** (accepts) · [[sources/s5|Introducing Scalar]] · Clean up pack-files
  > However, there is still a problem. If we let the number of pack-files grow without bound, Git cannot hold file handles to all pack-files at once. Rewriting pack-files could also reduce space costs due to better delta encoding. To solve this problem, Scalar has a pack-file maintenance step which performs an \*incremental\* repack by selecting a batch of small pack-files …
