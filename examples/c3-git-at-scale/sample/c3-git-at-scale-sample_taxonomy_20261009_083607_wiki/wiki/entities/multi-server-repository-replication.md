# Multi-server repository replication

Maintaining several repository copies on different servers for distributed availability and consistency.

## Evidence

- **s01_p02** (accepts) · [[sources/s1|Git at any scale]] · What's hard about Git?
  > The challenge in hosting Git repositories at scale is inherent in the design of Git itself: a \*distributed\* version control system means that all instances of a repository are identical. There's nothing special about the repository on a Git server that doesn't apply to a repository on a developer's laptop. Although at first it may appear that this makes hosting …
- **s01_p07** (accepts) · [[sources/s1|Git at any scale]] · Spokes and Consistency
  > Spokes is a \*consensus-based\* distributed system. It works by storing several copies of your Git repository on different servers. Whenever you push new data, an orchestrator fans out your push so that every instance of your repository receives a copy. The "fan-out" is synchronized with a classic consensus algorithm called 3PC (three-phase commit) so that a push is only accepted …

  > This is essentially how Spokes works, and it has been working quite well for the past 13 years. Of course, Spokes is not perfect — no system is. In 2026, the way people use Git repositories has changed drastically, and we have learned many important lessons about building distributed systems along the way. Time and experience have shown which of …

  > Before Spokes, we used DRBD filesystem block-level replication to keep repositories duplicated. This system was very sensitive to latency, so we were forced to keep fileserver replicas right next to each other. This was obviously not ideal, and getting off of it was the motivation that drove the initial development of Spokes. As soon as we had Spokes running, we …

- **s03_p03** (accepts) · [[sources/s3|Building resilience in Spokes]] · Availability
  > Spokes’s availability is a function of the availability of underlying servers and networks, and of our ability to detect and route around server and network problems. Individual servers become unavailable pretty frequently. Since rolling out Spokes this past spring, we have had individual servers crash due to a kernel deadlock and faulty RAM chips. Sometimes servers provide degraded service due …
