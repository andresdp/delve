# Unsynchronized packfile distribution

Sending packfiles to hosts without consensus because their objects remain unreachable until references are updated.

## Evidence

- **s01_p07** (accepts) · [[sources/s1|Git at any scale]] · Spokes and Consistency
  > Spokes is a \*consensus-based\* distributed system. It works by storing several copies of your Git repository on different servers. Whenever you push new data, an orchestrator fans out your push so that every instance of your repository receives a copy. The "fan-out" is synchronized with a classic consensus algorithm called 3PC (three-phase commit) so that a push is only accepted …
- **s01_p13** (accepts) · [[sources/s1|Git at any scale]] · Compaction
  > Write-ahead logs require periodic compaction. You cannot let the log grow unbounded: a full restore replays every entry, so the more entries, the more expensive it becomes. Coincidentally, a normal Git repository \*also\* requires periodic compaction, even though Git is not based on a WAL. We've seen that the fundamental unit of storage in a Git repository is the \*packfile\*. …
