# Fully consistent replica synchronization

Keeping all repository replicas synchronized so reads observe recently committed Git state.

## Evidence

  > Spokes was originally developed at GitHub around 2013, and it has since become an industry standard. Most Git hosting services use a variant of the Spokes approach (application-level replication for Git repositories) in their architecture. The main reason Spokes has worked well for many years is that it made three fundamental choices that, over time, have been proven to be …

  > Replication and compaction are the two key factors that determine how well a Git storage system behaves under load. As we’ve just seen, they’re intrinsically linked: the more pushes per second a repository ingests, the more read performance degrades, because the packfiles of every push must be compacted for Git operations to remain efficient. If you replicate these pushes, the …
