# Background repository maintenance

Deferring repository upkeep to background processes instead of interactive commands.

  > What about Linux? There is potential for porting Scalar to Linux, so please comment on this issue if you would use Scalar on Linux. In the rest of this post, I’ll share three important lessons that informed Scalar’s design: Finally, I share our plan for contributing these features to the Git client. You can get started with Scalar using the …

  > These logs show the details from updating the Git commit-graph in the background, the equivalent of the \`scalar run commit-graph\` command. You can run maintenance in the foreground using the \`scalar run\` command. When given the \`all\` option, Scalar runs all maintenance steps in a single command: \`\`\` $ scalar run all Setting recommended config settings...Succeeded Fetching from remotes...Succeeded Updating …

  > \*There is no free lunch\*. Large repositories require upkeep. We can’t make users wait, so we defer these operations to background processes. Git typically handles maintenance by running garbage collection (GC) with the \`git gc --auto\` command at the end of several common commands, like \`git commit\` and \`git fetch\`. Auto-GC checks your \`.git\` directory to see if certain thresholds …

  > The config step updates your Git config settings to some recommended values. The config step runs in the background so that new versions of Scalar can update the registered repositories after install. As new config options are supported, we will update the list of settings accordingly. Some of the noteworthy config settings are: 1. We disable auto-GC by setting \`gc.auto=0\` …

  > - Scalar relies on a stable and correct filesystem watcher to scale growth in modified size, and Watchman does that decently well. However, Watchman is a much more general tool than we need, and it isn’t “Git aware.” It doesn’t know when a directory matches a \`.gitignore\` pattern and that we don’t need to scan it for changes. By creating …
