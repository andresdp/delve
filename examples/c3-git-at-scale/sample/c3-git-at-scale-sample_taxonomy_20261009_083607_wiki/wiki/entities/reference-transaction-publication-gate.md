# Reference-transaction publication gate

Separating durable ingestion from visibility by requiring a prepared reference transaction and recorded log pointer.

## Evidence

- **s01_p10** (accepts) · [[sources/s1|Git at any scale]] · Continuity
  > Continuity is the Git storage system we've developed at Cursor, with a very clear approach: learning from everything that Spokes did well, and fixing the things that, after many years, we now know are problems. \*Continuity\* is a simple system (a system cannot be easy to operate if it is not simple). The core primitive behind it is a write-ahead …
- **s02_p04** (accepts) · [[sources/s2|Stretching Spokes]] · Git reference update transactions
  > Three-phase commit is a core part of keeping the replicas in sync. Implementing it requires each of the replicas to be able to answer the question “can you carry out the following reference updates?”, and then to either commit or roll back the transaction based on the coordinator’s instructions. To make this possible, we implemented transactions for Git reference updates …
