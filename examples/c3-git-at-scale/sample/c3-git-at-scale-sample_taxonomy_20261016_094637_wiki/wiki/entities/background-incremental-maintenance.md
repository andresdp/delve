# Background incremental maintenance

Repository maintenance runs incrementally in the background rather than blocking interactive operations.

## Evidence

- **s01_p13** (accepts) · [[sources/s1|Git at any scale]] · Compaction
  > Write-ahead logs require periodic compaction. You cannot let the log grow unbounded: a full restore replays every entry, so the more entries, the more expensive it becomes. Coincidentally, a normal Git repository \*also\* requires periodic compaction, even though Git is not based on a WAL. We've seen that the fundamental unit of storage in a Git repository is the \*packfile\*. …
- **s04_p02** (accepts) · [[sources/s4|Scalar philosophy]]
  > Using \`scalar register\` on an existing Git repository will give you these benefits: \* Additional compression of your \`.git/index\` file. \* Hourly background \`git fetch\` operations, keeping you in-sync with your remotes. \* Advanced data structures, such as the \`commit-graph\` and \`multi-pack-index\` are updated automatically in the background. \* If using macOS or Windows, then Scalar configures Git's builtin File …
- **s05_p01** (accepts) · [[sources/s5|Introducing Scalar]]
  > Git is a \*distributed\* version control system, so by default each Git repository has a copy of all files in the entire history. Even moderately-sized teams can create thousands of commits adding hundreds of megabytes to the repository every month. As your repository grows, Git may struggle to manage all that data. Time spent waiting for \`git status\` to report …
- **s05_p03** (accepts) · [[sources/s5|Introducing Scalar]] · Quick start for existing repositories
  > These logs show the details from updating the Git commit-graph in the background, the equivalent of the \`scalar run commit-graph\` command. You can run maintenance in the foreground using the \`scalar run\` command. When given the \`all\` option, Scalar runs all maintenance steps in a single command: \`\`\` $ scalar run all Setting recommended config settings...Succeeded Fetching from remotes...Succeeded Updating …
- **s05_p09** (accepts) · [[sources/s5|Introducing Scalar]] · Lesson 3: Don’t wait for expensive operations
  > \*There is no free lunch\*. Large repositories require upkeep. We can’t make users wait, so we defer these operations to background processes. Git typically handles maintenance by running garbage collection (GC) with the \`git gc --auto\` command at the end of several common commands, like \`git commit\` and \`git fetch\`. Auto-GC checks your \`.git\` directory to see if certain thresholds …
- **s05_p10** (accepts) · [[sources/s5|Introducing Scalar]] · Set recommended Git config settings
  > The config step updates your Git config settings to some recommended values. The config step runs in the background so that new versions of Scalar can update the registered repositories after install. As new config options are supported, we will update the list of settings accordingly. Some of the noteworthy config settings are: 1. We disable auto-GC by setting \`gc.auto=0\` …
- **s05_p12** (accepts) · [[sources/s5|Introducing Scalar]] · Clean up loose objects
  > As you work, Git creates “loose” objects by writing the data of a single object to a file named according to its SHA-1 hash. This is very quick to create, but accumulating too many objects like this can have significant performance drawbacks. It also uses more disk space than necessary, since Git’s pack-files can compress data more efficiently using delta …
- **s05_p13** (accepts) · [[sources/s5|Introducing Scalar]] · Clean up pack-files
  > However, there is still a problem. If we let the number of pack-files grow without bound, Git cannot hold file handles to all pack-files at once. Rewriting pack-files could also reduce space costs due to better delta encoding. To solve this problem, Scalar has a pack-file maintenance step which performs an \*incremental\* repack by selecting a batch of small pack-files …
