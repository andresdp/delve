# Scalar interim performance layer

Scalar supplies needed client performance temporarily while equivalent capabilities move into core Git.

  > The Philosophy of Scalar ======================== The team building Scalar has opinions about Git performance. Scalar takes out the guesswork by automatically configuring your Git repositories to take advantage of the latest and greatest features. It is difficult to say that these are the absolute best settings for every repository, but these settings do work for some of the largest repositories …

  > Using \`scalar register\` on an existing Git repository will give you these benefits: \* Additional compression of your \`.git/index\` file. \* Hourly background \`git fetch\` operations, keeping you in-sync with your remotes. \* Advanced data structures, such as the \`commit-graph\` and \`multi-pack-index\` are updated automatically in the background. \* If using macOS or Windows, then Scalar configures Git's builtin File …

  > Git is a \*distributed\* version control system, so by default each Git repository has a copy of all files in the entire history. Even moderately-sized teams can create thousands of commits adding hundreds of megabytes to the repository every month. As your repository grows, Git may struggle to manage all that data. Time spent waiting for \`git status\` to report …

  > What about Linux? There is potential for porting Scalar to Linux, so please comment on this issue if you would use Scalar on Linux. In the rest of this post, I’ll share three important lessons that informed Scalar’s design: Finally, I share our plan for contributing these features to the Git client. You can get started with Scalar using the …

  > When using \`scalar clone\`, the working directory contains only the files at root using the Git sparse-checkout feature in \*cone mode\*. You can expand the files in your working directory using the \`git sparse-checkout set\` command, or fully populate your working directory by running \`git sparse-checkout disable\`. \`\`\` $ cd scalar/src $ ls AuthoringTests.md Directory.Build.targets SECURITY.md global.json CONTRIBUTING.md License.md Scalar.ruleset …

  > We intentionally are making Scalar do \*less\* and investing in making Git do \*more\*. Scalar is simply a way to get the performance we need today. As Git improves, Scalar can provide a way to transition away from needing Scalar and using only the core Git client. Scalar also serves as an example for the kinds of features we need …
