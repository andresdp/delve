# Geographically nearby read replicas

Fetches and clones are served from replicas close to users to reduce transfer distance.

  > Even with all of these optimizations, a reference update still costs about a third of a second. This is fine in most situations. But in the case that we mentioned earlier, where an update to \`master\` might cause a cascade of more than a hundred bookkeeping reference updates, processing the updates could keep the repository busy for something like 30 …

  > Spokes’s availability is a function of the availability of underlying servers and networks, and of our ability to detect and route around server and network problems. Individual servers become unavailable pretty frequently. Since rolling out Spokes this past spring, we have had individual servers crash due to a kernel deadlock and faulty RAM chips. Sometimes servers provide degraded service due …

  > As described above, Spokes can deal quickly and transparently with a server going offline or even failing permanently. So, can we use that for planned maintenance, when we need to reboot or retire a server? Yes and no. Strictly speaking, we can reboot a server with \`sudo reboot\`, and we can retire it just by unplugging it. But there are …
