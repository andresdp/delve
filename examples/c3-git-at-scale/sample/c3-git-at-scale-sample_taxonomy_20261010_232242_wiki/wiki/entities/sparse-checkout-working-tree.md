# Sparse-checkout working tree

Materialize only selected repository paths, including cone-mode patterns and later selective expansion, to reduce client working-tree scope.

## Evidence

- **s04_p02** (accepts) · [[sources/s4|Scalar philosophy]]
  > Using \`scalar register\` on an existing Git repository will give you these benefits: \* Additional compression of your \`.git/index\` file. \* Hourly background \`git fetch\` operations, keeping you in-sync with your remotes. \* Advanced data structures, such as the \`commit-graph\` and \`multi-pack-index\` are updated automatically in the background. \* If using macOS or Windows, then Scalar configures Git's builtin File …

  > Git is a \*distributed\* version control system, so by default each Git repository has a copy of all files in the entire history. Even moderately-sized teams can create thousands of commits adding hundreds of megabytes to the repository every month. As your repository grows, Git may struggle to manage all that data. Time spent waiting for \`git status\` to report …
- **s05_p04** (accepts) · [[sources/s5|Introducing Scalar]] · Quick start for using the GVFS protocol
  > When using \`scalar clone\`, the working directory contains only the files at root using the Git sparse-checkout feature in \*cone mode\*. You can expand the files in your working directory using the \`git sparse-checkout set\` command, or fully populate your working directory by running \`git sparse-checkout disable\`. \`\`\` $ cd scalar/src $ ls AuthoringTests.md Directory.Build.targets SECURITY.md global.json CONTRIBUTING.md License.md Scalar.ruleset …
- **s05_p06** (accepts) · [[sources/s5|Introducing Scalar]] · Populated size
  > How many paths in the index are actually in your working directory? This is normally equal to the number of tracked files in the index, but Git’s sparse-checkout feature can make it smaller. It takes a little bit of work to design your repository to work with sparse-checkout, but it can allow most developers to populate a fraction of the …
- **s05_p07** (accepts) · [[sources/s5|Introducing Scalar]] · Modified Size
  > The \*modified size\* is the number of paths in the working directory that differ from the version in the index. This includes all files that are untracked or ignored by Git. This size determines the minimum amount of work that Git must do to update the index and its caches during the core commands. Without assistance, Git needs to scan …
- **s05_p08** (accepts) · [[sources/s5|Introducing Scalar]] · Lesson 2: Reduce object transfer
  > Now that the working directory is under control, let’s investigate another expensive dimension of Git at scale. Git expects a complete copy of all objects, both currently referenced and all versions in history. This can be a massive amount of data to transfer — especially when you only need objects near your current branch do a checkout and get on …
- **s05_p15** (accepts) · [[sources/s5|Introducing Scalar]] · Scalar and the future of Git
  > - Scalar relies on a stable and correct filesystem watcher to scale growth in modified size, and Watchman does that decently well. However, Watchman is a much more general tool than we need, and it isn’t “Git aware.” It doesn’t know when a directory matches a \`.gitignore\` pattern and that we don’t need to scan it for changes. By creating …
