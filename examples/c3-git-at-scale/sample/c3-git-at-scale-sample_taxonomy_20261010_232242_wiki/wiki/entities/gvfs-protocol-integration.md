# GVFS protocol integration

Scalar supports the ecosystem-specific GVFS protocol alongside standard Git performance mechanisms.

## Evidence

- **s04_p01** (accepts) · [[sources/s4|Scalar philosophy]]
  > The Philosophy of Scalar ======================== The team building Scalar has opinions about Git performance. Scalar takes out the guesswork by automatically configuring your Git repositories to take advantage of the latest and greatest features. It is difficult to say that these are the absolute best settings for every repository, but these settings do work for some of the largest repositories …
- **s05_p01** (accepts) · [[sources/s5|Introducing Scalar]]
  > Git is a \*distributed\* version control system, so by default each Git repository has a copy of all files in the entire history. Even moderately-sized teams can create thousands of commits adding hundreds of megabytes to the repository every month. As your repository grows, Git may struggle to manage all that data. Time spent waiting for \`git status\` to report …
- **s05_p03** (accepts) · [[sources/s5|Introducing Scalar]] · Quick start for existing repositories
  > These logs show the details from updating the Git commit-graph in the background, the equivalent of the \`scalar run commit-graph\` command. You can run maintenance in the foreground using the \`scalar run\` command. When given the \`all\` option, Scalar runs all maintenance steps in a single command: \`\`\` $ scalar run all Setting recommended config settings...Succeeded Fetching from remotes...Succeeded Updating …
- **s05_p09** (accepts) · [[sources/s5|Introducing Scalar]] · Lesson 3: Don’t wait for expensive operations
  > \*There is no free lunch\*. Large repositories require upkeep. We can’t make users wait, so we defer these operations to background processes. Git typically handles maintenance by running garbage collection (GC) with the \`git gc --auto\` command at the end of several common commands, like \`git commit\` and \`git fetch\`. Auto-GC checks your \`.git\` directory to see if certain thresholds …
- **s05_p10** (accepts) · [[sources/s5|Introducing Scalar]] · Set recommended Git config settings
  > The config step updates your Git config settings to some recommended values. The config step runs in the background so that new versions of Scalar can update the registered repositories after install. As new config options are supported, we will update the list of settings accordingly. Some of the noteworthy config settings are: 1. We disable auto-GC by setting \`gc.auto=0\` …
- **s05_p15** (accepts) · [[sources/s5|Introducing Scalar]] · Scalar and the future of Git
  > - Scalar relies on a stable and correct filesystem watcher to scale growth in modified size, and Watchman does that decently well. However, Watchman is a much more general tool than we need, and it isn’t “Git aware.” It doesn’t know when a directory matches a \`.gitignore\` pattern and that we don’t need to scan it for changes. By creating …
