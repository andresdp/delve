# Elastic per-repository replica allocation

Replica count expands or contracts according to repository read demand and durable-source availability.

  > Having a write-ahead log in S3 opens a world of possibilities when it comes to scale. We can have \*literally\* any number of replicas, because the scalability of S3 is unmatched and all the replicas catch up directly from there. We perform optimistic replication by sending gossip UDP packets around our cluster. The packets contain all the required metadata for …

  > Replication and compaction are the two key factors that determine how well a Git storage system behaves under load. As we’ve just seen, they’re intrinsically linked: the more pushes per second a repository ingests, the more read performance degrades, because the packfiles of every push must be compacted for Git operations to remain efficient. If you replicate these pushes, the …

  > If a repository exists on exactly three replicas, then a successful write on two replicas constitutes both a durable set, and a majority. If a repository has four or five replicas, then three are required for a majority. In contrast, many other replication and consensus protocols have a single primary copy at any moment. The order that writes arrive at …
