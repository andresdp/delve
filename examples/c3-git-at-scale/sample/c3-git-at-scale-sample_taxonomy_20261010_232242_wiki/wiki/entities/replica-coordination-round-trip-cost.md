# Replica coordination round-trip cost

Distributed replica coordination requires multiple network round trips, adding latency to repository operations.

## Evidence

- **s02_p03** (supports) · [[sources/s2|Stretching Spokes]] · Reducing round-trips
  > Due to the speed of light and other annoying facts, every round-trip communication to a distant replica takes time. For example, a network round-trip across the continental US takes something like 60-80 milliseconds. It wouldn’t take very many round trips to use up our time budget. We use the three-phase commit protocol to update the replicas and additionally use the …
