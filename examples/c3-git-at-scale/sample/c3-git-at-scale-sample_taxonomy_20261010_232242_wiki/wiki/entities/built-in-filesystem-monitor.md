# Built-in filesystem monitor

Git's filesystem monitor accelerates status and add operations in repositories with many working-tree files.

## Evidence

- **s04_p02** (accepts) · [[sources/s4|Scalar philosophy]]
  > Using \`scalar register\` on an existing Git repository will give you these benefits: \* Additional compression of your \`.git/index\` file. \* Hourly background \`git fetch\` operations, keeping you in-sync with your remotes. \* Advanced data structures, such as the \`commit-graph\` and \`multi-pack-index\` are updated automatically in the background. \* If using macOS or Windows, then Scalar configures Git's builtin File …
- **s05_p05** (accepts) · [[sources/s5|Introducing Scalar]] · Lesson 1: Focus on the files that matter
  > The most common Git commands are \`git status\` to see what change are available, \`git add\` to stage those changes before committing, and \`git checkout\` to change your working directory to match a different version. We call these the \*core commands\*. Each core command inspects the working directory to see how Git’s view of the working directory agrees with what …
- **s05_p07** (accepts) · [[sources/s5|Introducing Scalar]] · Modified Size
  > The \*modified size\* is the number of paths in the working directory that differ from the version in the index. This includes all files that are untracked or ignored by Git. This size determines the minimum amount of work that Git must do to update the index and its caches during the core commands. Without assistance, Git needs to scan …
- **s05_p15** (accepts) · [[sources/s5|Introducing Scalar]] · Scalar and the future of Git
  > - Scalar relies on a stable and correct filesystem watcher to scale growth in modified size, and Watchman does that decently well. However, Watchman is a much more general tool than we need, and it isn’t “Git aware.” It doesn’t know when a directory matches a \`.gitignore\` pattern and that we don’t need to scan it for changes. By creating …
